1.	SELECT * (ALL) 
	retrives all columns (everthing)

2.	FROM (tells SQL where to find your data)
	 example:
	SELECT * FROM customers
3. select few columns 
pick only the columns you need insted of all

SELECT 
col 1,
col 2
FROM TABLE

Retrieve each customer's name, country and score

SELECT * 
FROM 
customers

SELECT 
	first_name,
	country,
	score
FROM 
	customers 

and if i change the order the in display there also will be changed
SELECT
	score,
	first_name,
	country

FROM 
	customers

4. WHERE
filters your data based on your condition 

SELECT *
FROM TABLE
WHERE CONDITION
 
IF WE NEED FROM SEPECFIC COLUMN WHICH MEET THE CONDITION MEANS

SELECT 
	first_name,
	country
FROM 
	customers

WHERE score != 0

Retrieve customers with a score not equal to O
SELECT *
FEROM
	customers
WHERE 
	score != 0
Retrieve customers from Germany
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Germany'

Retrieve customers not from Germany
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country != 'Germany'

Retrieve first_name, id where customers from Germany
SELECT first_name, id
FROM customers
WHERE country != 'Germany'

5.ORDER BY
sort your data either ASCENDING or DESCENDING
ASC = lowest to highest 
DESEC = highest to lowest
if dont specify ASC or DESEC by default it ASC

SELECT *
FROM TABLE
ORDER BY

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY score DESC


SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY score DESC


SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE score <= 500
ORDER BY score DESC

Retrieve all customers and
sort the results by the highest score first.
SELECT *
FROM customers

ORDER BY score desc

Retrieve all customers and
sort the results by the lowest score first
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY score ASC


SELECT first_name, country
FROM customers
WHERE score <= 500
ORDER BY score desc

SELECT first_name, country
FROM customers
WHERE score <= 500
ORDER BY score desc

SELECT first_name, country
FROM customers
WHERE score  = 0 
ORDER BY score desc

SELECT first_name, country
FROM customers
WHERE score  ! = 0 
ORDER BY score desc

Retrieve all customers and sort the results by the country and then by the highest score
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY 
country ASC,
score DESC

6. GROUP BY
combines the row with the same value
aggregates a cloumn by another column
total score by country


Find the total score for each country

SELECT 
	country ,
	SUM(score) AS Total_score
from 
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country






SELECT 
	country ,
	first_name,
	SUM(score) AS Total_score
	
FROM
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country, first_name

order by Total_score desc



SELECT 
	country ,
	first_name,
	SUM(score) AS Total_score
	
FROM
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country, first_name
HAVING SUM(score) > 800
order by Total_score desc

Find the total score and total number of customers for each country
SELECT
    country,
    SUM(score) AS total_score,
    COUNT(id) AS customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY country;


8.HAVING

can be used only with Group BY
 
VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT (core of the image)
WHERE = Before aggregation
HAVING = After aggregation

Filter → Before → WHERE

Filter → After → HAVING

filters the data after aggregation


SELECT 
	country ,
	SUM(score) AS Total_score
FROM
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country
HAVING SUM(score) > 800



SELECT 
	country ,
	SUM(score) AS Total_score
	
FROM
	customers
GROUP BY 
	country
HAVING SUM(score) > 800
order by Total_score desc

Find the average score for each country considering only customers with a score not equal to O And return only those countries with an average score greater than 430

SELECT 

country,
AVG(score) as Avrage_score
FROM customers
WHERE score!=0
GROUP BY country
HAVING AVG(score)>430


9. DISTINCT
removes  Duplicates(Repeated VALUES)
each value apperas only once
Bad Habit with DISTINCT
Don't use DISTINCT unless it's necessary; it can slow down your query


Return Unique List of all countries

SELECT DISTINCT
country
FROM customers

10. TOP (Limit)
restrict the no rows returned
and it will give top rows

Retrive only 3 customers
SELECT TOP 3
*
FROM customers

Retrive the top 3 customers with the highest scores
SELECT TOP 3
*
FROM customers
ORDER BY score DESC

Retrieve the Lowest 2 Customers based on the Score
SELECT TOP 2
*
FROM customers
ORDER BY score ASC 

Get the two most recent orders
SELECT TOP 2
*
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date desc
